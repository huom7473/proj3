>>>>INCLUDED FILES<<<<

The following files have been included as per the spec's requirements:

lab3b.py:
(executable) Python source module that takes in exactly one argument, a csv
in the format provided by the spec, and produces the required output.

Makefile:
A Makefile implementing the targets (default, dist, and clean) required by the
spec. 'make default' and 'make lab3b' are equivalent - they both produce the
symlink lab3b, which points to lab3b.py.

README:
this README.

>>>>NOTES<<<<
IMPORTANT: The lab3b.py file will only execute properly on the SEASnet linux servers,
due to the shebang line.

There might be some possible file system inconsistencies that our code doesn't check
for, since they weren't mentioned in the spec. For example, if one directory ended up
being the child of two directories, as long as the directory was correctly listed
as a child in the directory that '..' pointed to.

Another example is if a directory didn't have a . or .. entry. If this occured in
a test csv, the program considers them to refer to inode -1 and print out
the appropriate error message. Since the spec didn't mention this case and
therefore didn't specify an error messge for them, we figured this would suffice,
especially since this case wasn't present in any of the test cases.

As for testing methodology, we used the samples provided to unit test "features"
as we added them, and relied on the sanity check to do a more thorough check.
It would've been too time consuming to create our own CSV samples testing edge cases.
